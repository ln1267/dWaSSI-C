Please update this file with relevant information about how to run this code.

-----------------
The Struction of WaSSI model

Main program:

general.f90 
	This is the main file for the whole program. It contants the main 3 nested do loops for grids, year and month. Besides, the year and month loops should be run orderedly, and they are relevant to previous loop. 
	It reads input data from 5 TXT files where colums are separated by ",".
	
Subroutines:
	
warmup.f90
	This subroutine is mainly used for reading data from input files and write some basic runnning information to ouput file.

PET.f90 
	It is used for simulating PAET(year,month) for the following simulation.(As PAET did not include grid information, We may be need to change it in the future.)
	There is no relevant in this matrix
	
Waterbal.f90 
	This is the main file for data processing.
	It contants a day loop for the following simulation. The struction details can be found in the "Waterbal.png".( There is a bit differece between this framwork and the code, but the main calculation part is the same. The code does not have the K loop)" 

Output.f90 
	This is used for summary the main results and write them to outputs files.
	It has two nested loops. (Year and month loop)
	
Summary.f90
	This is similar to output file, but it only have year loop.

Carbonbal.f90	
	This is also for output.
	
Validation.f90 
	Write data to output file.

# 	  How to use Makefile 		#
#########################################

To compile first make sure that the Makefile is updated for the machine that you are compiling on.
The default setting is for Magnus. To compile, type:
make

This should produce some objects with extensions *.o and a.out which is your executable.

To clean the project just type:
make clean 
and it should delete all except the source files.
